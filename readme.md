# BoatEgo

This project started as a joint coding project with my youngest son.  I wanted to expand our simple game engine to allow for a board games.  This project uses C# and a WinForms shell.  

BoatEgo is a strategy game where soldiers of two colors (Red [you] and Blue [your opponent]) battle to control the territory and find your opponents flag (before they find yours).
